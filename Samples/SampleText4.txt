H7 is thought to have evolved from an 055:H7-like progenitor (1,
2). 0157:H7 is the most common enterohemorrhagic E. coli se
rotype found in North America. Although causing disease in
humans, E. coli 0157:H7 does not appear to affect cattle, a major
reservoir for this organism (3, 4). The E. coli 0157:H7 lineage is
distinguished from other E. coli serotypes by its highly homoge
nous population structure, comparable to clonal microbial species
such as Yersiniapestis (5) or Bacillus anthracis (6). During the last 3
decades, E. coli 0157:H7 has established itself as a major enteric
pathogen, capable of causing large outbreaks of gastrointestinal
disease. E. coli 0157:H7 infections usually have a food-borne
etiology (7). The virulence in E. coli 0157:H7 has been attributed
to the lateral acquisition of genetic determinants, such as the
virulence plasmid p0157, the prevalence of a set of phylogeneti
cally unrelated prophages (8) [in particular Shiga-like toxin (stx)
converting phages, which can carry different stx subtypes (9)], O
islands (10, 11), the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), the
arginine translocation system (12), and adhesion factors (13, 14).
However, little is known about the genomic diversity that exists
among extant populations of E. coli 0157:H7 or how various
genotypes of this pathogen relate to development and severity of
human disease, thus underscoring the need to understand the
genome dynamics and plasticity of this important pathogen. In the
context of this study, "population" is defined as a group of isolates
temporally related and linked through strain-associated metadata,
such as time (period), source, outbreak, or genotypic assignment.
Infected patients present with a range of gastrointestinal mor
bidities such as severe abdominal cramping with little or no as
sociated fever and a watery diarrhea, which can develop into se
vere bloody diarrhea (15). Although many infected with the
pathogen remain asymptomatic, an estimated 15-20% of people
infected with E. coli 0157:H7 present with indications severe
enough to require hospitalization. In such cases, symptoms may
progress to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), hemorrhagic co
litis, and CNS failure with potentially lethal outcomes (16-18).
Three widely publicized food-associated outbreaks of E. coli
0157:H7 infections in 2006 captured the attention of the US
Congress as well as the public health, forensic, and lay commu
nities (19). E. coli 0157:H7 continues to be a significant public
health threat. Recent outbreaks have been associated with the
emergence of apparently more virulent E. coli 0157:H7 clones,
with more than 50% of infected persons hospitalized and many
patients presenting with more severe clinical and potentially life
threatening complications (19). These outbreaks were traced to
ingestion of contaminated fresh produce and are referred to as the
"spinach" (SP), "Taco Bell" (TB), and "Taco John" (TJ) out
breaks. The spinach incident was a multistate outbreak (26 states)
that caused 199 illnesses and at least three deaths. Among the ill,
51% (102 patients) were hospitalized, and in 16% of the cases (31
patients), infection progressed to HUS and kidney failure (19).
Much research has been done to understand the pathogenesis of
E. coli 0157:H7, but data addressing selection and adaptation of
variants during the time course of a single outbreak of human
disease are lacking. In this study the genetic analysis of 231 E. coli
0157:H7 strains, the genome sequences of 26 isolates (18 of which
were obtained for this study) allowed unprecedented insights into
the genomic plasticity and genome dynamics of the genetically
homogenous E. coli 0157:H7 lineage. This extensive dataset en
abled a detailed analysis of the types of host selection and adap
tation occurring during the time course of a single outbreak on
a genome- and population-wide scale. This study identified nu
merous biomarkers that aided in the development of a more re
fined and accurate phylogenomic framework and contributed to
the investigation of the genetic relatedness of individual strains
and their assignment into distinct virulence cla
